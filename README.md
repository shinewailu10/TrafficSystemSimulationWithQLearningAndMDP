This project implements a simulated four-way traffic intersection using Pygame, where vehicles are generated, move, queue and leave based on simple physics and traffic rules. A Q-learning agent controls the traffic signals by observing the number of waiting cars in each lane and selecting which direction receives the green light at each step. The agent is trained over 200 episodes for now, storing learned behaviour in a “traffic_brain.pkl” file. Training and evaluation are run from “main.py”, the Q-learning logic is implemented in “agent.py” and the traffic environment, some MDP functions such as reward system and simulation visuals are implemented in “function.py”. A GUI launcher built with Tkinter allows users to train a new agent, run the trained agent, or reset the model. Training performance is evaluated by the reward system and comparing the agent against a fixed-time controller over last 5 episodes and visualised using Python matplotlib library.
